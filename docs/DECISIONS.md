## Group model (Phase 3, Step 7)

**Purpose.** A `Group` represents one actual offering of a `Course` during a
specific `AcademicTerm` -- e.g. "Group A" of "General English" in "Fall 2026".
It is the entity that future milestones will attach student enrollments,
teacher assignments, schedules, and attendance to. None of those
relationships exist yet -- this step is the database/model foundation only.

**Group -> AcademicTerm.** Many-to-one, required (`academic_term_id`,
`NOT NULL`, indexed FK to `academic_terms.id`). An `AcademicTerm` can have
many `Group`s (`AcademicTerm.groups`).

**Group -> Course.** Many-to-one, required (`course_id`, `NOT NULL`, indexed
FK to `courses.id`). A `Course` can have many `Group`s (`Course.groups`).

**Level is derived through Course, not duplicated.** A `Group` does not have
a `level_id` column. The level is already reachable via
`Group -> Course -> Level`, and a `Course` cannot change level after
creation without an explicit admin action on the course itself. Storing
`level_id` on `Group` as well would let the two disagree (e.g. a course
moved to a different level while a group still pointed at the old level)
with nothing in the schema to prevent it. Reading the level through the
existing relationship (`group.course.level`) keeps the level facts in a
single place.

**Uniqueness.** Group names are **not** globally unique. Two different
`Course`s, or the same `Course` in two different `AcademicTerm`s, may each
have a "Group A" -- this is normal (e.g. the same course repeats every
term). What must be unambiguous is a group name *within one course, in one
term*: `UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, name)`. The optional
`code` field follows the same scope:
`UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, code)`, with multiple groups
allowed to leave `code` blank in the same term/course (MySQL treats
multiple `NULL`s in a unique index as distinct, matching the existing
`Level.code` / `Course.code` convention).

**Capacity.** Required positive integer, enforced with a database
`CHECK (capacity > 0)` constraint -- the same pattern already used for
`AcademicTerm`'s `start_date < end_date` check, rather than a duplicate
Python-level validator.

**Archiving, not deleting.** `Group` reuses the shared `AcademicStatus`
enum (`active` / `archived`) and has no delete route or method, consistent
with `AcademicTerm`, `Level`, and `Course` -- future enrollment/attendance
history may reference a group long after it stops running.
