# Project Decisions

## Group model (Phase 3, Step 7)

**Purpose.** A `Group` represents one actual offering of a `Course` during a
specific `AcademicTerm` -- e.g. "Group A" of "General English" in "Fall 2026".
It is the entity that future milestones will attach student enrollments,
teacher assignments, schedules, and attendance to. None of those
relationships exist yet -- this step is the database/model foundation only.

**Group -> AcademicTerm.** Many-to-one, required (`academic_term_id`,
`NOT NULL`, indexed FK to `academic_terms.id`). An `AcademicTerm` can have
many `Group`s (`AcademicTerm.groups`).

**Group -> Course.** Many-to-one, required (`course_id`, `NOT NULL`, indexed
FK to `courses.id`). A `Course` can have many `Group`s (`Course.groups`).

**Level is derived through Course, not duplicated.** A `Group` does not have
a `level_id` column. The level is already reachable via
`Group -> Course -> Level`, and a `Course` cannot change level after
creation without an explicit admin action on the course itself. Storing
`level_id` on `Group` as well would let the two disagree (e.g. a course
moved to a different level while a group still pointed at the old level)
with nothing in the schema to prevent it. Reading the level through the
existing relationship (`group.course.level`) keeps the level facts in a
single place.

**Uniqueness.** Group names are **not** globally unique. Two different
`Course`s, or the same `Course` in two different `AcademicTerm`s, may each
have a "Group A" -- this is normal (e.g. the same course repeats every
term). What must be unambiguous is a group name *within one course, in one
term*: `UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, name)`. The optional
`code` field follows the same scope:
`UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, code)`, with multiple groups
allowed to leave `code` blank in the same term/course (MySQL treats
multiple `NULL`s in a unique index as distinct, matching the existing
`Level.code` / `Course.code` convention).

**Capacity.** Required positive integer, enforced with a database
`CHECK (capacity > 0)` constraint -- the same pattern already used for
`AcademicTerm`'s `start_date < end_date` check, rather than a duplicate
Python-level validator.

**Archiving, not deleting.** `Group` reuses the shared `AcademicStatus`
enum (`active` / `archived`) and has no delete route or method, consistent
with `AcademicTerm`, `Level`, and `Course` -- future enrollment/attendance
history may reference a group long after it stops running.

## Group delete policy (Phase 3, Step 12)

**Decision: no hard delete. Archive (`active` -> `archived`) is the only
lifecycle transition, and it is already implemented (Step 11,
`POST /admin/groups/<public_id>/toggle-status`).**

Reasoning:

- A `Group` is the entity that student enrollments, teacher assignments,
  schedules, attendance, grades, and assignments will all eventually
  reference (see the `groups` purpose note above). None of those
  relationships exist in the schema yet, but the whole point of `Group`
  existing before them is to be their stable anchor. A hard delete route
  built now would need to be revisited (and re-secured) the moment any of
  those future foreign keys land -- either by blocking deletion once
  children exist, or by cascading, which risks silently destroying
  enrollment/attendance history. Building it now, before there is anything
  to protect against, would mean designing it twice.
- This mirrors the decision already made and shipped for `AcademicTerm`,
  `Level`, and `Course`: all three are archive-only, no delete route
  exists for any of them, and every admin list page already reads on
  "Active"/"Archived" rather than existence. `Group` following the same
  rule keeps one consistent lifecycle model across the whole Academic
  Core instead of a special case for one table.
- Nothing observed while building Steps 7-11 changes this: no current
  feature needs to permanently remove a `Group` row, and archiving already
  satisfies every real requirement seen so far (hide it from active use,
  keep the historical record, allow reactivation if it was archived by
  mistake).

No delete route, delete button, or delete confirmation was added anywhere
in the Group admin pages. If a genuine need for permanent removal appears
later (e.g. a compliance/data-retention requirement), it should be
designed at that time against the actual relationships that exist then,
with explicit relationship checks and cascade rules -- not built
speculatively ahead of the data model that would make it safe.
