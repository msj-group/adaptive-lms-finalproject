# Project Decisions

## Group model (Phase 3, Step 7)

**Purpose.** A `Group` represents one actual offering of a `Course` during a
specific `AcademicTerm` -- e.g. "Group A" of "General English" in "Fall 2026".
It is the entity that future milestones will attach student enrollments,
teacher assignments, schedules, and attendance to. None of those
relationships exist yet -- this step is the database/model foundation only.

**Group -> AcademicTerm.** Many-to-one, required (`academic_term_id`,
`NOT NULL`, indexed FK to `academic_terms.id`). An `AcademicTerm` can have
many `Group`s (`AcademicTerm.groups`).

**Group -> Course.** Many-to-one, required (`course_id`, `NOT NULL`, indexed
FK to `courses.id`). A `Course` can have many `Group`s (`Course.groups`).

**Level is derived through Course, not duplicated.** A `Group` does not have
a `level_id` column. The level is already reachable via
`Group -> Course -> Level`, and a `Course` cannot change level after
creation without an explicit admin action on the course itself. Storing
`level_id` on `Group` as well would let the two disagree (e.g. a course
moved to a different level while a group still pointed at the old level)
with nothing in the schema to prevent it. Reading the level through the
existing relationship (`group.course.level`) keeps the level facts in a
single place.

**Uniqueness.** Group names are **not** globally unique. Two different
`Course`s, or the same `Course` in two different `AcademicTerm`s, may each
have a "Group A" -- this is normal (e.g. the same course repeats every
term). What must be unambiguous is a group name *within one course, in one
term*: `UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, name)`. The optional
`code` field follows the same scope:
`UniqueConstraint(academic_term_id, course_id, code)`, with multiple groups
allowed to leave `code` blank in the same term/course (MySQL treats
multiple `NULL`s in a unique index as distinct, matching the existing
`Level.code` / `Course.code` convention).

**Capacity.** Required positive integer, enforced with a database
`CHECK (capacity > 0)` constraint -- the same pattern already used for
`AcademicTerm`'s `start_date < end_date` check, rather than a duplicate
Python-level validator.

**Archiving, not deleting.** `Group` reuses the shared `AcademicStatus`
enum (`active` / `archived`) and has no delete route or method, consistent
with `AcademicTerm`, `Level`, and `Course` -- future enrollment/attendance
history may reference a group long after it stops running.

## Group delete policy (Phase 3, Step 12)

**Decision: no hard delete. Archive (`active` -> `archived`) is the only
lifecycle transition, and it is already implemented (Step 11,
`POST /admin/groups/<public_id>/toggle-status`).**

Reasoning:

- A `Group` is the entity that student enrollments, teacher assignments,
  schedules, attendance, grades, and assignments will all eventually
  reference (see the `groups` purpose note above). None of those
  relationships exist in the schema yet, but the whole point of `Group`
  existing before them is to be their stable anchor. A hard delete route
  built now would need to be revisited (and re-secured) the moment any of
  those future foreign keys land -- either by blocking deletion once
  children exist, or by cascading, which risks silently destroying
  enrollment/attendance history. Building it now, before there is anything
  to protect against, would mean designing it twice.
- This mirrors the decision already made and shipped for `AcademicTerm`,
  `Level`, and `Course`: all three are archive-only, no delete route
  exists for any of them, and every admin list page already reads on
  "Active"/"Archived" rather than existence. `Group` following the same
  rule keeps one consistent lifecycle model across the whole Academic
  Core instead of a special case for one table.
- Nothing observed while building Steps 7-11 changes this: no current
  feature needs to permanently remove a `Group` row, and archiving already
  satisfies every real requirement seen so far (hide it from active use,
  keep the historical record, allow reactivation if it was archived by
  mistake).

No delete route, delete button, or delete confirmation was added anywhere
in the Group admin pages. If a genuine need for permanent removal appears
later (e.g. a compliance/data-retention requirement), it should be
designed at that time against the actual relationships that exist then,
with explicit relationship checks and cascade rules -- not built
speculatively ahead of the data model that would make it safe.

## Student account management (Phase 3, Student Milestone)

**User.public_id.** The `users` table only had an internal numeric `id`.
Student (and every other role's) detail/edit/status/password-reset URLs
must never expose that internal id, so `User` now carries the same
`public_id` (UUID, unique, non-null) pattern already used by
`AcademicTerm`, `Level`, `Course`, and `Group`. Existing rows (the
Administrator) were backfilled with a generated UUID by the migration
before the column was tightened to NOT NULL -- see
`migrations/versions/a23634066372_*.py` for the exact steps.

**Session invalidation (`auth_version`).** Suspending a student, resetting
their password, or changing their login email must kill any session
issued before that action -- otherwise a browser that is still logged in
would keep working after being suspended. `User` gained a small integer
`auth_version` column for this. `User.get_id()` (used by Flask-Login to
build the session cookie) returns `"{id}.{auth_version}"` instead of just
the id; the `user_loader` in `app/__init__.py` parses both parts back out
and rejects the session if the stored version no longer matches the
user's current `auth_version`. `bump_auth_version()` is called on status
toggle, password reset, and email change. This is the smallest change
that fits the existing Flask-Login integration -- no JWT, no server-side
session store, no new framework.

One expected, one-time side effect: every session that existed *before*
this migration was created with the old `get_id()` format (just the raw
id, no version suffix). The user_loader cannot parse that old format and
treats it as invalid, so **every currently logged-in user, including the
Administrator, will be signed out once** the first time they load a page
after this change ships. They simply log in again normally; no data is
affected.

**Password policy for administrator-set student passwords.** Minimum 15
characters, maximum 128, no composition rules (no forced uppercase /
digit / symbol). This favours passphrases over short-but-complex
passwords, following the length-over-composition principle discussed in
guidance such as NIST SP 800-63B -- this is **not** a claim of full
compliance with that document. The minimum was deliberately set above the
more commonly cited 12-character baseline because this application
currently authenticates with a password as the sole factor: there is no
MFA, so the password alone is the entire barrier to an account. Two
things NIST SP 800-63B also recommends are explicitly **not** implemented
yet and are recorded here as future improvements rather than oversights:
blocklisting known-compromised or common passwords, and a password
strength meter/feedback at input time. The maximum exists only to bound
the input size reaching Argon2id, not as a usability restriction.

**No `must_change_password` flag.** A forced first-login password change
would need a student-facing login/dashboard flow to redirect into, and
that does not exist yet. Adding the column now without anywhere to act on
it would be a half-finished control. Recorded here as a follow-up once
the Student dashboard exists: the Administrator currently hands the
temporary password to the student out of band (never by email -- no
email service is approved), and the student keeps using it until an
administrator resets it.

**Student delete policy.** Same reasoning as Groups: student accounts use
the Active/Suspended lifecycle only, there is no delete route or button.
Future Enrollments, Attendance, Grades, Payments, and research records
may reference a student long after they stop attending, and audit/history
records must not be able to silently lose their subject. Permanent
deletion, if ever required, must be designed later as a deliberate
privacy/data-retention workflow evaluated against whatever relationships
exist by then -- not implemented now as ordinary CRUD deletion.
